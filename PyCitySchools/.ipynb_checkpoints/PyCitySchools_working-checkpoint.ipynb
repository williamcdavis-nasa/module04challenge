    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the PyCitySchools District there are a total of 15 High Schools serving a combined enrollment of 39,170 students. The operating cost of these 15 schools is approximately $24.65M. Standardized test scores within the district show approximately 3 in 4 students pass math (75.0%) and 5 in 6 students pass reading (85.8%); only 2 out of 3 students pass both math and reading (65.2%).\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyCitySchools District includes 7 District schools and 8 Charter Schools. The District schools tend to have significantly larger enrollments, with the smallest being Ford High School with 2739 students and the largest being Bailey High School with 4976 students. This is in stark contrast to the Charter schools where the largest campus is Wilson High School with 2283 students and the smallest campus is Holden High School with just 427 students. At all schools, the average math score fluctuates between 76 â€“ 84 whereas the reading score fluctuates within a smaller range of 80-84. \n",
    "\n",
    "The five top performing schools are all Charter schools with an overall passing rate of 90.5% or better for all enrolled students. The five bottom performing schools are all District schools with an overall passing rate of 53.5% or lower for all enrolled students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Math scores at each high school are generally flat across all 4 grades and do not show improvement or decline. Reading scores at each high school show the same trend and are also generally flat across all 4 grades and do not show any marked improvement or decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparing the amount of money spent per student to test score performance, there appears to be an inverse relationship to testing performance outcomes. The more that is spent, the fewer students who pass math, reading, or overall. Therefore, increasing spending does not correlate to improved test scores. Similarly, comparing the size of each school to test score performance, there again appears to be an inverse relationship. The larger the school, the fewer number of students who pass math, reading, or overall. The best test scores and highest pass rates occur at the smaller schools, which in PyCitySchools District tends to be Charter schools.\n",
